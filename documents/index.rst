HornPenguin Booklet
===============================================

.. image:: _static/main.png


HornPenguin Booklet is a free and open source booklet generating program. 
It can take an input PDF file and reorder, rotate and transform it's
pages to generate pages which can be folded into signatures. This process
is called imposition. It can also add printing markers for color printing.

Documents from simple pamphlets to complex book signatures can be printed
on a home printer. Here are some of the features:

* Signature sizes from 4 to 64 pages are supported.
* Imposition.
* Control page size during imposition.
* Right to Left riffling direction is supported for old Asian, Hebrew, and
  Arabic bookbindings, in addition to the normal Left to Right.
* Printing markers can be added: trim, CMYK, and signature proofs.
